Country roads
Take me home 
to the place
I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road, I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
